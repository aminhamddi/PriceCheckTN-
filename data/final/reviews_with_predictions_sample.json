After a few days, I noticed that I'd finished my coffee hours earlier than usual every single morning with the back-up mug. Normally I sip on my coffee until it's nearly lunchtime, but now I was finishing it on my morning commute.\n\nThe next morning I was thinking about this and realized exactly what the cause was: My Contigo mug kept my coffee so hot that I could not take big gulps of it and it took me until 11 am to get through it. The back-up mug cooled so quickly that I was gulping my coffee by the time I got in the car.\n\nAfter less than a week I ordered a new Contigo and I will be a customer for life now.\n\nThis mug will keep your coffee pipingly, tongue-burningly hot for hours when sealed. Like others have said, I actually leave the lid off for a couple of minutes after I pour and blow on it to bring it down to a drinkable temperature because I know once I seal the lid it's staying that hot. The more of the coffee you drink the more it will start to lose its heat (because you're replacing hot coffee with room-temperature air with every sip, which is cooling the remaining coffee). But the cooling happens slowly enough that the only time the liquid inside of it really gets *cold* is when the cup is less than half full and the snap lid is open, which is letting a lot of air circulate inside the cup. If you leave it full, it will stay *hot*--not warm--for 7 hours.",

As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the \"pilot in charge\" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.

While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect. Just make sure to go down one full size in order to achieve the optimal fit.",

The Cyberex is one of the best parts, but it is also really fun that you can lock a bad guy, or Batman, in to the stomach cage of Cyberex, which is also a great place to store Batman when you are done playing!\nWhen Batman rides on his back, you can push on a button under Cyberex's tail that makes a top part pop up and you can push a button to get red discs to shoot out at the 'bad guys\" which is a big hit with both boys, and is easy enough for even my 3 yr old to work on his own. It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the \"go to\" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately! I like the bright blue coloring with the sliver and gold since it makes it look more robotic. Batman is the perfect size! It is a very fun Batman toy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a gift!

I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?\n I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it.",
